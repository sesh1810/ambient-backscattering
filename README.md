# Ambient Backscattering for wireless CRN's
This project focusses on displaying a Performance analysis and optimisation of wireless-powered Cognitive Radio Networkâ€™s using ambient backscatter communications. 
An exploratory study has been performed on the variation of three important components in a communication system - OutageProbability, Throughput, and Energy Efficiency - with 
1. Number of secondary users
2. Distance of separation between the primary and secondary transmitters
3. Reflection coefficient

The work described in this study is benchmarked against two base models - Nakagami fading model and Rayleigh.
