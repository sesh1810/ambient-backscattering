# Ambient Backscattering for CRN's
This project focusses on displaying a Performance analysis and optimisation of wireless-powered Cognitive Radio Networkâ€™s using ambient backscatter communications. 
An exploratory study has been performed on the variation of three important components in a communication system - OutageProbability, Throughput, and Energy Efficiency - with 
1. Number of secondary users
2. Distance of separation between the primary and secondary transmitters
3. Reflection coefficient

Our proposed model -
